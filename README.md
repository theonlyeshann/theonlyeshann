👋 Hi, I’m Eshann Saxena  
🎓 Computer Science student @ The University of Texas at Dallas

📄 **Resume:** [View my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gdl7oVnyDgvpIdM6JSsQ7wY4EJWzfKSZ/view?usp=sharing)

I’m learning how to build software by actually building it — one project, one bug, and one improvement at a time 🚀

---------------------

## 🙋‍♂️ About me
I’m a CS student who learns best by doing 🛠️  
Classes give me the foundation, but most of my growth comes from working through real projects — figuring out structure, fixing bugs, and understanding *why* things break.

I’m especially interested in frontend development 🎨 and how good structure and design make software easier to scale and maintain.

---------------------

## 🧠 What I’m working on now
### 🏗 Basketball101 (Work in Progress)
**Tech:** React ⚛️ | Next.js | TypeScript

Basketball101 is a modernization of a legacy basketball education website. I’m rebuilding it from static HTML/CSS into a component-based React application with scalability in mind 📈

🔹 What I’ve focused on so far:
- Migrating static pages into reusable React components  
- Structuring the project for long-term maintainability  
- Building responsive layouts that work across devices 📱💻  

🔮 What’s coming next:
- Performance improvements  
- Future AI-driven features (roadmap in place)

---------------------

## 🛠️ Tech I’m using & learning
**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++  
**Frameworks:** React, Next.js  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm  

---------------------

## 🤝 Team & collaboration experience
- Worked in **Agile-style environments** with distributed and offshore teams  
- Collaborated across time zones using Git, GitHub, and clear documentation  
- Gained experience breaking down tasks, iterating on feedback, and shipping incrementally  

---------------------

## 🌍 Outside of code
- 🏀 Basketball film analysis and stats  
- 🗣 Multilingual: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi  
- 🤝 Enjoy collaborating and learning from others
